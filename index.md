Plan:

Emlyn and Orin suspect that there is a traitor in The Hosue of Eyes. But with the deception possibly going all the way to the top, how can know who to trust.

And with the kings assassination bringing nations of Verris and Kris to the brink of war, it is more important than ever that level heads prevail.

But due to their unwitting participation in the assassination, they are facing severe persecution within their own government.

-

Meanwhile, Emlyn's dreams have been steadily worsening. The lack of sleep and constant night terrors begins affecting her waking life. Others start to notice what is happening, and Orin is torn between what is best for Emlyn, his career and his paternal feelings towards her.

Orin is meanwhile fighting a cutthroat battle to keep his head above water in the inner politics of The House of Eyes. Much of his political capital has been lost to debacle in Rens, and what little is left, is being lost due to protect Emlyn.

Orin needs to desperately seek new allies, and perhaps ones that he would rather not pursue.

-

Marcus and Jake are not forgotten either, but they have their own concerns. Believed to be part of the conspiracy to assassinate the king, they have flown into secrecy, Jake leaving his family behind.

To be honest, I don't know what I am going to do with them.

-

In the end, after much political wheeling and dealing, Orin and Emlyn will seem as though they have finally got to the bottom of things.

However, in the final chapter, they will receive a macguffin, and everything will fall into place. The person that they trusted most will be shown to be a traitor. But before they can do anything, an arrest party will come to arrest them.

They will only just manage to escape with their lives, but to what end? To what end?
